    <h3>
      Read this first
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Mithral Client-Server Software Development Kit allows people
      to quickly and easily write large scale client-server applications
      including "distributed computing" and "GRID" applications.
      Examples of what this will allow you to build with this technology are
      distributed.net, SETI@Home, Napster, Gnutella, and hundreds of other
      applications. The example code is an instance of an application
      that hands out work for the clients to do, then collects the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CS-SDK is a kit that should allow a first-year programmer
      to take an application and make it into a client-server application
      in a weekend. Naturally, if your application doesn't already
      exist, than you have a few months of project design and development
      ahead of you. Also, if your application was not written
      to be portable, you will also have additional work to do integrating
      the Cosm CPU/OS layer with your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing you will have to do to use this kit is get familiar
      with client-server architectures. If you're not familiar with
      client-server models, find someone who is to help you with your
      project. Your mistakes can cause untold headaches for network
      adminitrators if you design your project incorrectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next you will need to install the Cosm libraries, read the
      Programmers Guide, license, and API documentation. These can all be
      found on the Mithral web site. Read them. You will also need to be
      familiar with the correct use of ANSI C. In general you should avoid
      use of the C standard library, unsafe functions have been replaced with
      functions in the Cosm API. Not following the documentation will
      result in non-portable and error-prone applications. Reading all the
      documentaiton and getting the libraries installed should take a few
      hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that reading, return to this document and finish reading it.
      It will make little sense until you read the previously mentioned
      documentation. Now go do the reading, which we all know you didn't
      do yet ;) If you skipped even this "read this first" reading, then
      eventually you'll be back looking for a reason your project doesn't
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest should be relatively straitforward, if not let us know.
      Read this document, read the three .h and two .c files, `make` the
      example and play with it. Look at how the code does what it does.
      The example should run without changes since it's configured to run
      on localhost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you should be ready to rip out the example code, and put in
      your own. Join us in the IRC channel #cosm on Open Projects Net IRC for
      help and to chat with others working on projects - someone may just
      be awake when you /join.

    <a name="Structures"></a>
    <h3>
      Structures
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are 5 structures in common.h that you need to know about and
      modify for your project.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>PACKET_REQUEST
      <dd>A request from the client to the server for some work. The
        only read data needed is the amount of work the client expects to do
        in a day.
      <dt>PACKET_ASSIGNMENT
      <dd>Assignment from the server to the client containing all the data
        needed to do a piece of work. Number ranges, raw data, etc.
      <dt>PACKET_RESULTS
      <dd>Results of the work, sent back to the server. Should contain the
        results as well as who did the work and other data you need for
        statistics.
      <dt>PACKET_ACCEPT
      <dd>Acknowledgement from the server that the work results were
        recieved and saved. This allows the client to delete the work.
        A simple PASS/FAIL is enough.
      <dt>PACKET_ACTIVE
      <dd>This isn't so much a packet, since it only exists on the client,
        but it needs to be treated as such (endian issues etc.) when saved
        to the CLIENT_DATAFILE. This contains the work assignments along
        with any temporary data. Work may be in an unstarted, unfinished
        (checkpointed), or finished state ready to go back to the server
        when in this structure.
    </dl>

      <strong>Client files</strong> (client.h)
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>CLIENT_DATAFILE

      <dt>WORK_LOG
      <dd>Log of completed work, along with statistical data.
      <dt>ACTIVITY_LOG
      <dd>Log for other activity like network and debug information.
    </dl>

    <a name="Logging"></a>
    <h3>
      Logging
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Client logging</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the client the CLIENT_LOG should include everything that
      you would send to the screen. At lower log levels this may just
      be the work being received and sent. At higher levels you may want
      to include additional things like networking logs, or progress
      indicators.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Server logging</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the server there are (at least) two logs. The WORK_LOG should
      log work recieved as done, along with the time, user, and other data
      needed for statistics processing. The ACTIVITY_LOG is for all other
      logging, including network connections, startup/shutdown messages,
      diagnostics, or other debug information.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <a name="Networking"></a>
    <h3>
      Networking
    </h3>
    <p>
      You will need to change both NETPACKET_SERVER and NETPACKET_PORT in
      common.h for the full hostname and port your server will run on.
      Anything above port 1024 will work, but 10204 is recommended,
      becasue nothing else is assigned in the 10200-10300 range.
      NETPACKET_HTTPSERVER and NETPACKET_HTTPPORT also need to be sent
      projects that will tunnel through HTTP. NETPACKET_HTTPPORT should
      usually be 80 or 8080.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are going to use HTTP tunneling on port 80, you need
      to first be sure your servers dont already have web servers running.
      You may only want HTTP modes, or you can keep both, which will
      preaty much get through any firewall.

    <a name="Examples"></a>
    <h3>
      Examples
    </h3>
    <p>
      The example code is part of the standard files. This was done because
      most all of what you have to do to customize for your own project is
      to simply replace what's done in the example. If you want a "clean"
      version, just delete everything but the defines and function
      declarations.
