/*
  Times are signed s128's, 64b.64b format based 0 = 00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1,
  2000 AD. This gives a Range of +/- 2.923E11 years and a resolution of
  5.421E-20 seconds. This allows times from bang to crunch - assuming a closed
  universe (if it's not closed, we have bigger problems). It's also useful for
  timing the half lives of particles like Neutral Sigma Baryons.

  Useful constants:
  Beginning of time: 80000000, 00000001
  End of time: 7FFFFFFF, FFFFFFFF
  microsecond: 000010C6, F7A0B5ED
  millisecond: 00418937, 4BC6A7EF
  centisecond: 028F5C28, F5C28F5C
