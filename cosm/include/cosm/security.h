  /*
    Generate public_key and private_key with a bits bit n.
    Please read this entire description, as many parameters have
    special meanings and restrictions. Knowing what you're doing before
    using any PKI functions would be a very good idea.

    bits must be at least 512, and a power of 2.
    Keys less then 1024bits are now considered breakable by large
    organizations, and 512 bit keys are breakable with a few computers
    in a few weeks, so 2048 and 4096 bit keys are recommended.

    rnd_bits should be bits bits of random data.
    It is VERY important that the user take great care to make sure
    that these bits are truely random, and not based on any data
    such as the time. CosmPRNG and CosmEntropy are also not enough on
    their own.

    id has specific ranges and meanings:
    0    to 2^31-1: local human ID.
    2^31 to 2^32-1: local machine ID.
    2^32 to 2^63-1: global Cosm-assigned human ID.
    2^63 to 2^64-1: global Cosm-assigned machine ID.
    When printed in hex, local IDs are 8 digits, and global ID are 16 digits.
    Local ID are use within each organization, often something like an
    employee number, or a customer number for example. Global IDs should
    not be used to identify people once they are in a local domain, the local
    ID should be used instead for privacy and security reasons.
    That something is using a human ID does NOT imply they are an adult
    that can sign contracts, nor any form of intelligence.

    create is the time of key creation and should always
    be the current time. expire is the expiration time
    of the keys. CosmPKIEncode() will not be allowed with an
    expired key. Most keys should have a lifetime of 1 year.

    A key is uniquely identified by the bits,
    id, and create. This means that keys
    should not be generated more then once a second, this should not
    be a big concern. You should also never generate a key with a
    id you haven't been assigned, because it will not
    result in a valid key.

    alias is a max 15 byte utf8 string that has no
    special meaning except to the key's owner as a tool to quickly
    tell keys apart. No special meaning should be given beyond that.

    callback and callback_param provide information
    on the possibly long key generation process. They work as decribed
    in CosmBNPrimeGen, with the added calls of
    callback( 3, 0, callback_param ) when the keypair test begins and
    callback( 4, 0, callback_param ) when the test finishes.
    Note that 2 primes will be generated during key creation.

    Returns: COSM_PASS on success, or an error code on failure.

    a public key to decode.
    It is important to understand that the undecoded parameters of a
