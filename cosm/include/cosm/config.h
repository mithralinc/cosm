/*
  Dealing with config files

<begin file>
[section1]\n
key1=value1\n
key2=value2\n
\n
[section2]\n
key1=value1\n
key2=value2\n
\n
</end file>

The Rules:
  These are binary files, not text. You're not supposed to have to edit them.
  No linefeeds (\n) in section/keys/values - those are line separators.
  No '=' or '[' in keys, and avoid ']'.
  Everything is case sensitive.
  Blank lines are ignored, but added at the end of sections for humans.
  Any improperly formatted line is discarded.
  Comment lines don't exist, that's what documentation is for.
  The majority of cases the config will only be read, so optimize for
  reading.
