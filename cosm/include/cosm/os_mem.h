    Attempts will be made to:
      - The memory will be protected from read or write from any other
        process including supervisor run programs or other processes owned
        by the same user, unless explicitly given access by the process.
      - The memory will not be swapped or otherwise copied out of live RAM
        including during a crash triggered dump.
      - The memory will not be shared to another machine.
      - The parts of the kernel in supervisor space will not be modified
        after boot (which would allow access).
    Never reallocate secure memory, as it will lose these protections.
    Many systems do not support exnhanced security memory at all, or for
    non-root/Administrator programs, which is the cause of nearly all security
    problems.

    Memory should also be aligned on 16 byte boundries similar to
    CosmMemAlloc. If memory is NULL, this function acts like CosmMemAlloc.
    If bytes is zero, then free the memory, and return NULL.
    Any expanded memory space will have unknown values.
