Modifications Since Phase 1
---------------------------

If you did not use the phase 1 Cosm API, then you do not need to read this
document, and should insted consult the current documentation.

It's been 10 years since the innitial 1995/6 design of the Cosm APIs. Since
then compilers and hardware have advanced, and even C itself has changed. Add
in 10 years of feedback, you'll see why some things have changed since then.

CPU/OS
------

general:
  - the "v3" prefix has been replaces with variations of "Cosm", and the
    naming convention has been modified. Check the programmers guide.
  - Files and headers in the CPU/OS layer are now os_* instead of cosm* to
    remove the confusion between the low level CPU/OS layer and the high level
    Cosm layer.
  - Compilers now support 64bit data types for C99 compatability. This makes
    the 32<->64bit conversion and math macros unnecessary, and are removed.
    For constants use the "LL" or "ULL" suffix, e.g. 42LL.
  - The {type}Load/Save/Add and other functions like v3u64Add now follow
    the naming conventions with the uppercase U/S.
  - V3_HAVE_U64 has been removed.
  - The defines and methods related to CosmTest() have been changed to reduce
    code size and complexity. See cosm.html.
  - Endian defines can now be used at compile time and/or run time.
  - v3_time is now cosmtime.
  - CPU and OS types updated, many removed.
  - The COSM_OS_TYPES string "MacOSX" is now just "OSX".
  - fixed the _V3_ (now _COSM_) macro's to allow nested expansion.
  - DynamicLib (aka DLL, shared library) functions have been added (os_task).
os_file:
  - Save/Load is now a macro on big endian systems.
  - offset and length are no longer tracked internally, use the functions.
  - DirOpen's V3_DIR_MODE_READ flag removed as redundant.
  - Add COSM_FILE_MODE_NOBUFFER file mode.
  - Memory mapped file functions have been added.
os_io:
  - Strings and os_io are now fully UTF-8.
    bignum, config, log, security, are also UTF-8. os_file (files/dirs),
    email, net, http, os_task (commands), are ascii protocols of course.
  - The string library (os_io) now uses u32 instead of u64 in most cases.
    This is for better performance and ease of use.
  - f128 type added for your hardcore math needs.
    f128 in CosmPrint() is %g and %G.
  - CosmPrint() %n and %N are removed from the documention (never existed)
  - CosmStrLength is now CosmStrBytes for clarity.
os_math:
  - Cosmf64NaN/Inf are now CosmFloatNaN/Inf.
  - Cosm[u64|u128]DivMod are now public functions. For signed math, still use
    the separate Div and Mod functions.
os_mem:
  - CosmMemAlloc/Realloc no longer need the COSM_MEM_NORMAL/SECURE flag, there
    is a separate CosmMemAllocSecure function for allocating secure memeory.
  - CosmMemWarning has been removed. If your OS has no memory protection, then
    there is nothing you can do about it. But whatever precautions can be
    taken will be, like zero on free.
  - Named shared memory functions have been added.
  - You can now use -DMEM_LEAK_FIND no matter if the libs are compiled with
    it or not, the functions now always exist.
os_net:
  - Full IPv6 support.
  - CosmNetOpen is simplified, and the parameters reordered correctly.
  - CosmNetOpenSocks is now a separate, and depreciated function, so
    CosmNetOpen takes 2 less parameters. SOCKS proxies have not been in
    common use for over 5 years, as host-based filtering has taken over.
  - IP addressses are now a struct cosm_NET_ADDR, not a u32 ip with u16 port.
    This is for IPv6 support, unfortunately this does require user code
    changes. Since Win32, Linux, and OSX all support IPv6, this is no
    longer an issue.
    os_net, http and email were also effected.
  - CosmNetMyIP() has another parameter and may now return more then one IP.
    Expect at least 2+ IPv4 address, and possibly 1+ IPv6 ones as well.
  - CosmNetACLTest is now CosmNetACLCheck to avoid confusion with all of the
    "Test" functions.
  - The mask parameter of the NetACL* functions is now mask_bits, and is
    handled differently. If you were using it, your code will need changes.
  - cosm_NET no longer keeps firewall settings in memory.
  - With IPv6 comes threadsafe DNS lookups, feel free to use DNS functions
    from more then one thread.
  - WIN32 systems now needs at least winsock 2.0.
os_task:
  - CPUGet has been removed.
  - Mutex's now have an Init function. Mutex's should also be unlocked in
    the same thread they are locked in. This is change is due to
    performance and portability issues. Use Semaphores for cross-thread
    locking.
  - CosmMutexUnlock now returns void.
  - CosmProcessSignal is now CosmSignal.
  - Named Semaphore functions have been added.


Utility
-------
bignum:
  - v3BNA -> CosmBNStr
  - v3BNMovInv is fixed
buffer:
  - Create -> Init, to conform with the standard.
compress:
  - The Base64 transform has been moved out of compress.* into transform.* this
    leaves compress.* as empty files and so they have been removed.
transform:
  - Transform API simplified greatly, and are now chainable. This will require
    some manual changes to code.
http:
  - Fix header sending for HTTP/1.0 headers.
  - New error COSM_HTTP_ERROR_VERSION for versioning errors.
  - Better handling of legacy 0.9 and 1.0 HTTPD requests.
security:
  - Changes to API to conform with transform API changes.
  - COSM_HASH_MD5SHA1 has been removed (too weak), replaced with SHA256
  - Both MD5 and SHA1 algorithms have been significiantly weakened by attacks
    since 1995, and should no longer be used for strong cryptography.
  - Key aliases are now 32 unicode bytes, reasonable length for asian users.
speed:
  - speed.* are now gone, the benchmarks there were not reliable. Replacement
    timing functions are now in time.*


Development Environment
-----------------------

- bzip2 and other libraries that plug into the Cosm API's are now separated
  into dirs/libraries along with their API glue and makefiles. To use them
  you will need to #include just the glue-header and link in the library.
  This is far more scaleable and less of a mess legally when code with other
  licenses has to be used. The header and lib should be installed to the same
  dir as the main Cosm headers and libs. Of course GPL, patented, or
  commerical code still cannot be used.
- All Cosm related files when installed now go into /usr/local/
  This means Phase 2 compatible files go into /usr/local/lib and
  /usr/local/include/cosm/.
  In Makefile.cosm COSM_LIB, COSM_INC, and COSM_MAN are defined and will
  always be consistent with whatever version you are writing for.
- The Makefile.cosm is created in the same dir as the headers.
- Adding makefiles for Intel's compiler on systems where it is free (Linux).
  The results only run on Pentium+/Itanium systems of course. Other build
  targets will be added over time as we migrate from phase 1.
- The generic apps/ and lib/ makefiles have been updated.
- Makefiles output is much more clear.
- CPU_WORD_SIZES is no longer needed.
- Memory tracking (for -DMEM_LEAK_FIND) is now threadsafe.
- NONPORTABLE_CODE is now ALLOW_UNSAFE_C, which is much clearer.
- NO_TRHEADS has been removed, all OS's now have threads.
- CPU_AMD64 is now CPU_X64. Intel is doing AMD64 too, thus the generic term.

Format and Style
----------------
- return statements now do not have ()'s like function calls.
- apps/indent.pro added. You'll need indent 2.2.9 or better. This should
  only be used in absolute emergencies on extremely bad 3rd party code.
  It likes to mix up the whitespace, and split hex strings in two. Beware.

Other
-----

- apps/p2update.pl <filenames> ...
  A perl app that allows automated updates of almost all code to p2 from p1.
  This corrects all the functions that have changed. Makefiles should be all
  that need manual conversions.
- apps/longlines.pl - quick little Perl app to find lines over 78 chars.
- Win32 and Linux now support CPU affinity, so CPULock/Unlock work.
- SOCKS users are on notice that support will be removed eventually, noone
  has run a network that way in years, and the code to support it is huge.
- The GUI API layer has been removed. GUIs will be native w/OpenGL. PERIOD.
- Incomplete MacOS 9 support dropped. MaxOS X still fully supported.
- Incomplete OS/2 and BeOS support was dropped.
- Support for Win95/98, WinME, Win2000 dropped. With no Microsoft support, and
  Cosm's need for security, these are no longer safe systems.

MANUAL CHANGES NEEDED:
----------------------

First run p2update.pl

Required:
- CosmTest -> predefines/usage has changed. See cosm.html for example.
- CosmMutexInit's must be added, and must be lock/unlocked in the same thread.
- CosmTransform API and CosmEncrypt macro API changes.
- CosmCompressInit -> Add a final NULL parameter where CosmCompressInit was.
- CosmNet -> Changes for cosm_NET_ADDR.
- CosmNetOpen - API change. CosmNetOpenSocks added but depreciated.
- CosmNetACL* -> API change.
- CosmNetMyIP -> API change, additional length parameter.
- CosmCPUGet - removed.
- Strings are now u32 based, compiler warnings will pop up in some places.
- Some CosmBNA -> CosmBNStr may be missed in cases of bad formatting.
- The COSM_MEM_NORMAL's the script didn't get need to be removed, and any
  COSM_MEM_SECURE need to be changed into CosmMemAllocSecure().
- Some 64bit math functions may remain if the script could not extract
  them safely. you will get errors for removed functions like v3u64Add.
