========================================================================
Phase 2 To Do List
========================================================================

This is a fine grained list of coding and documenting tasks that need
to be - Feel free to update once you have done something :)

Notes:
  * Any file that doesn't still need a format audit should only be edited
    with care (as is always the case). Be sure not to break the formatting.
  * "-" = Done barring bugs and porting, all functionality is implemented.
  * Any "!!!" in the code denotes a problem or unfinished section.

------
CODING
------

!!! MITHRAL LICENSE A/B !!! Fix code templates

Can safely reinit after a free/end without memset? check all functions?
Review #define/switch standard method?
Fix indent.pro
Unicode throughout? DNS + ...
Change all send/recv type functions to be 64b length?
Propogate the on left of comparisons throughout code, doc, examples.
Need #pragma pack() for all saveable/network structs

src/
  header audit - not all system headers may be needed
  struct alignment audit - may cause MAJOR problems on 64bit compilers
  audit for threadsafe and reentrant violations
  gets()-like functions for file and net?

src/cosm.h
  Expand the list of unsafe ANSI functions
    todo: stdio, stdlib, string
      ref: http://www.infosys.utas.edu.au/info/documentation/C/CStdLib.html

apps/p2update.pl
  remove
  CosmU64U32\({[^()]+}\)
  and 32 64
  CosmU64U32\({.*sizeof\(.*\).*}\)

2nd Party/
  bzip2 1.0.2 -> 1.0.5 - security vulnerability

-- CPU/OS layer --

src/cputypes
  -

src/os_file
  Memory mapped file tests
  Remove special file prefix processing
  Add CosmDirSpecial()
    cosm_root ( /bin, include, lib, etc)
    cosm_apps ( cosm/apps/<apps end up here> )
    config
    home
    documents
    temp
  Make file whipe optional on truncates?
  Issue - Set file permissions and date...
  Add buffered I/O?
  CosmDirGet - translating paths missing!!!
  make a helper function for mkdir stuff, DirOpen is a mess
  Win32 - CreateDirectory, any other Win32 API's?
  FileMove()
  file lock issues
    error handling in FileClose
    verify file locks are checked even if not currently locking
    generic file lock system
  CosmFileTruncate and all lock tests need to be added
  format and code audit (tests memory leak, not always freed)
  Figure out __USE_LARGEFILE64 and other flags for linux 64-bit files
  
src/os_io
  %-n. not working for strings
  StrStr, make sure that it cant run off either string...
  check: proper +127 to -128 ranges on numbers.
  Make CosmPrint work on chars, not bytes.
  CRITICAL: force scientific notation for big numbers.
            f128 has only 34 sig-figs. u128 has 39.
  BROKEN: \b needs to not get encoded
  return codes for CosmStr functions are seldom checked elsewhere.
  Fix API/return values to be consistent with pass/fail
  CosmInput code, test in testlib
  tighten up error cases in Cosm_ParseFloat
  tests
    CosmStr*
    Finish test setups and loops for  %u/v/w, %i/j/k, %X/Y/Z, %f/g/%F/%G,
      and move them to testlib.c - far too much overhead to be in the lib.
    Implement %c, %p, %s, %b tests
  test audit

src/os_math
  Add/Fix Mod functions with DivMod. In C99 "%" is remainder!
  CosmFloatInf/NaN tests

src/os_mem
  Shared memory tests in testlib Parent/Child
  mmap64?
  CosmMemAllocSecure - implement tracking and wipe.
    Win32: SecureZeroMemory()

src/os_net
  Add CosmNetStrAddr( utf8 string[40], cosm_NET_ADDR * addr )
  Fix ACL functions
    add an init, locking, need way to save/load ACLs
    add support for IPv6 addresses
    should work reguardless of NO_NETWORKING
  Muticast sockets
  IPv6 ( c = code, "-" = none needed )
      c CosmNetOpen
      - CosmNetSend
      - CosmNetRecv
      c CosmNetSendUDP
    CosmNetRecvUDP
      c CosmNetListen
    CosmNetAccept
      - CosmNetClose
      c CosmNetDNS
      c CosmNetRevDNS
      c CosmNetMyIP
  self tests take too long, this is the only slow selftest
  error checking for NULL ADDR parameters
  CosmNet*DNS() return more errors?
  CosmNetAccept( errors for socket errors in block/nonblock setting )
    does not always have to change block/nonblocking - just if changed
  test audit
    IPv6
    ACL function tests, my_host/my_port tests
    UDP tests

src/os_task
  Semaphore tests in testlib Parent/Child
  Semaphores need to allow for nameless as well?
  Affinity needs to be per thread.
    Win32 SetThreadAffinityMask().
    NPTL requires 2.4.20 (2002) more to require 2.6 from 2003.
    NPTL 2.3.3+ of glibc
  Redo Mutex tests
  Add condition variables for barriers?
  Create a blocking CosmProcessWait function? (vs. Spawn)
  startThread etc should allow null for id?
  fix POSIX violation with SIGCHLD ping/wait - fixable?
  SystemClock needs to use a divide for accuracy.
  find a place to test:
    CosmThreadPriority, CosmProcessPriority in testlib
  test audit

-- Utility layer --

src/bignum
  Fix the x/yz/ api for div/mod to div mod (fix all API names)
  DivMod shouldnt be a non-public function
  CosmBNA rename to BNStr
  add separator localization to the CosmBNPrint
  CosmBNPrint's _COSM_BN_CHECKMAX is broken once we localize
  Implement Montgomery Multiplication
  lots of error catching needs to be done

  code audit
  more tests for correctness and speed - pki-app/testlib

src/email
  This needs looking over, it's many years old.
  Change to CosmSMTPSend, fix parameters to ascii hostname, assume port 25
  -

src/hashtable
  expand primes table to 64bit machines
  tests (completely untested currently)
  *

src/http
  Re-test
  SECURITY: Cosm_HTTPDParseRequest
    path decoder can run off beyond input
    first line may not be long enough for the tmp[4] etc.
  match full "HTTP/1.1\r\n", full "POST "?
  accept IPv6 URI - http://[::FFFF:129.144.52.38]:80/index.html
  future proof version detection? (probably not relivant)

src/log
  high-volumn mode?

src/time
  CosmTimeSet code (cannot be done until packets are defined)

Porting
-------

MacOS X
  NetMyIP() has issues

Win32
  Network socket reuse options?
  Native filenames need to be turned to unicode
  Win32 port dirs, Info, Nativepaths, Delete
  GetSystemTime() in CosmSystemClock resolution is terrible, find better.
  replace mkdir() with Win32 API function
  CosmFileEOF doesn't work over shared drives (probably not fixable)
  CosmFileInfo access flags

Solaris/SunOS
  CPULock for solaris is buggy

Unix
  echo in CosmInput* for other Unix (done for Linux, FreeBSD, IRIX, OSF)

------------
OPTIMIZATION
------------

Optimizations are the _lowest_ priority tasks, and should only be done
after all other code is done, tested, and audited. But below is a list
of known non-optimial code.

CPU/OS
------
src/
  optimize functions with a u64 loop for 32 bit machines?
src/os_io:
  CosmStrStr needs rewriting for speed
  Cosm_PrintChar needs a length added for speed (and probably rename)
  Cosm_ParseFloat/Int isn't very optimized.
src/os_math
  Div and Mul functions

UTIL
----
src/
  ...
